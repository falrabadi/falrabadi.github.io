## Deployment 📦
- To deploy this project, we can use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- First, you need to create github repository with name `<your-github-username>.github.io`.
- Next, run `npm run build && npm run export` to generate your website's static files.
- Lastly, upload the contents of the `out` file to your repository and navigate to `<your-github-username>.github.io` to see your website live.
- I would recommend building a CI/CD pipeline through Github actions to automate the build and export process. [Here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-github-pages) is a useful article to get started.
